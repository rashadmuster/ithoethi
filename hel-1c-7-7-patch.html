Finally got back into fallout 4 and after messing around with some mods, ended up deciding on settling with horizon.

Preliminary: I have looked through all of the descriptions and help from the individual mods. I have been informed that one mod does not conflict by some sources and does by other \(Horizon and Start Me Up\). I'm having infrequent crashes in the overworld that I can't pinpoint what's wrong.

So I decided to boot up Skyrim again and have been playing for a couple of weeks now. I've noticed more recently that dragons are appearing, fighting, then disappearing. Either they fly off into the sky (https://imgur.com/a/kvoB5) or they just glitch (either through the floor or into a mountain). This is clearly a bug or mod issue, but I have used most of these mods before and never had this issue. Any ideas? Mod List coped from LOOT 0 0 Skyrim.esm 1 1 Update.esm 2 2 Dawnguard.esm.

Literally all the dialogue in my game is broken. This happened out of no where, it was working fine and then it wasnt. I havent installed a new mod since yesterday. I'll go up to a character and try to talk to them, and they just do the disinterested "yes?" or "need something?" but no dialogue options will appear, and there will be no audio. They talk to each other but not me. This includes merchants, guards, companions, Malborn, etc. I went back to an old save and it was still broken. 
Добрый вечер, господа! Тут такое дело - приобрели ноутбук с Windows 7, по привычке хотели поставить туда 1С'ку седьмую, ан не тут-то было. Просто тупо. Bought GOTY, Chucked 10 Mods In and keep Getting Periodic CTDs every 2-15 minutes. Thinking it might be load order but could be an incompatability. The Mods were pretty standard (OBSE, SR, Unofficial Patch, OOO, Better Cities, Immersive Weapons, Unique Landscapes, Oblivion Reloaded etc.) Wrye Bash not showing any red boxes etc anyway to tell which mod is crashing the game?
